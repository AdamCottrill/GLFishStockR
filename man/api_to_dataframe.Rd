\description{
Given a url submit the request and return the results as a
dataframe. If the response is paginated, the functions is called
recursively until all of the pages have been loaded ($next is
null). A maximum of 10 requests are made.  If the maximum number
of pages is reached, the function returns the data and issues a
warning that there may be additional data and that the filters
should be refined and multiple requests made and then combined to
ensure that all of the records selected by the filter are returned.
